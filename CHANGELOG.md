# Changelog

All notable changes to BuenAdoptante are documented here.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Schema health endpoint** (`/api/health`) — validates all database table columns against expected schema, catches migration drift
- **Schema smoke test** — Playwright test calls `/api/health` and fails with detailed mismatch report
- **Axiom error logging** on all 24 server action catch blocks — every error now reaches Axiom with context (function name, entity IDs, error ID)
- **Error ID propagation** — mutation errors include an error ID in thrown messages for end-to-end correlation (Axiom → server → toast → user)
- **Facebook import wizard** with AI extraction, duplicate detection, and i18n (EN/ES)
- **API route for adding records** (`/api/adopters/[id]/add-record`) with phased mutation logging

### Changed
- **Alert → toast migration** — replaced all 28+ `alert()` calls across 11 components with toast notifications (`useShowToast`)
- Adopter creation API route with duplicate/match checking

### Fixed
- **Production database schema** — manually applied 3 missing columns (`adopters.added_by`, `adoptions.record_type`, `adoptions.source_url`)
- **Staging database schema** — applied missing `adoptions.source_url` column
- Marked migration `0010` as applied in both environments
